%% Writing Scripts
%% Challenge #1
% Using the worked example as a model, create your own script that will extract the
% mean, maximum and minimum patient data and display this for the file 
% inflammation-02.csv. Save and execute this script (in a new .m file).

%% Challenge #2
% Plot mean, min, max and std calculated over all patients for each day in 
% a subplot. Arrange your subplot so that you have two plots in the first 
% row and two in the second row.
% Give all subplots x and y labels and a title.

%% Challenge #3
% Save the plot you generated as a png file in the current working directory.

%% Extension
% Using the 'hold' function plot the mean, minimum and maximum inflammation
% in the same figure. See if you can use different colours to differentiate
% between the different parameters. Add a legend to your figure. Save your
% figure as a png.
% See if you can save the file in a different format.
% See if you can figure out an additional way to save files.
