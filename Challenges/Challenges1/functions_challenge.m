%% Functions
% This file has the challenges for the functions lesson.

%% Challenge #1
% Write a function that takes two numbers and returns the sum of the numbers 
% and the product of the numbers (two inputs and two outputs).
% Include in the function an “if statement” that tests whether the sum or 
% product is bigger, and returns a third output that is a string stating 
% whether the sum or product is bigger (ie. ‘sum is bigger’ or ‘product is
% bigger’).

%% Extension 1
% Take the code you wrote to test whether two numbers are within 10% 
% and turn it into a function. Your function should take in two numbers as inputs, 
% and output 1 if the numbers are within 10% and 0 if they are not.

% HINT your syntax should look something like this
% out = function_name(num1,num2)
% 
% inside the function, create a variable called out, which equal
% either 1 or 0.
% (don't forget to write you will need to write your function in a new m-file & save it)

%% Challenge #2
% Make a function called “centre_shift” that will shift your data to a 
% desired mean, and use it in the analyse_data.m script.
% Add documentation to your function so that if you type “help centre_shift”
% in the command line, useful information about how to use the function will 
% show up.

%% Challenge #3
% In groups, discuss some ideas of what you might want to use functions for,
% and what would be your inputs and outputs to those functions.


%% Extension 3
% If you have time try and implement one of the functions you've discussed!
